I’m **Iker Elvi**, an audio engineer focused on **music production**, **post-production for film**, and **game audio**.

Audio engineer and music producer currently studying at SAE Barcelona, transitioning from 10 years in software development. I bring a **technical and creative** approach to audio production, with experience in recording, mixing, mastering and sound design, along with a strong background in digital tools, automation and innovation.

Music has always been an essential part of my life. As a guitarist and bassist, I have played in various bands and recorded studio albums, performing in renowned venues across Spain. This dual experience as a performer and producer allows me to approach sound with both precision and artistic sensitivity.
