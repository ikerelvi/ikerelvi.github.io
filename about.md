### Hi, I’m **Iker Elvi**
I’m an **audio engineer and sound designer** working across music production, post-production for film and game audio.

I bring a **technical + creative approach** to every project, blending my background in recording, mixing, mastering and sound design with a decade of experience in software development. This combination allows me to tackle both the artistic *and* technical sides of audio with precision.

#### 🎸 My Journey
As a guitarist and bassist, I’ve played in bands and recorded studio albums — from rehearsals to live shows — which shapes how I approach sound:  
balancing **musicality** with **technical clarity**.
